# oUF_Farva
Unit frames I've been working with since Cataclysm.

Largely based off oUF_Slim and oUF_Skaarj

Works with oUF version 8.0.2

Todo/Plans:

* update debuff whitelist
* add healcomm
* embed omf
* re-add experience and reputation bar
* ~~embed spellrange~~
* ~~remove classtags~~
* add cfg for raid icons, role icon, leader icon on party/raid frame
* update spellids for aurawatch
* add more screenshots
* ~~fix aurawatch icon remaining duration~~
* unsure, but might add ingame config if i have time
