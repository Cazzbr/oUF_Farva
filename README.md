# oUF_Farva
Unit frames I've been working with since Cataclysm.

Largely based off oUF_Slim and ouf_Skaarj

Works with oUF version 8.0.2

Todo/Plans:

* update debuff whitelist
* add healcomm4
* ~~embed spellrange~~
* ~~remove classtags~~
* add cfg for raid icons, role icon, leader icon on party/raid frame
* update spellids for aurawatch
* add more screenshots
* ~~fix aurawatch icon remaining duration~~
